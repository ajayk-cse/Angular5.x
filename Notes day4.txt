Why angular?

    Its a framework [browser/mobile]

    It is a modular framework
        what is modular:
            divide or slice your prog
            pick only the slice you need

    Performance

    Component architecture
        Web component development is bundle of below 3 layers:
            HTML
            CSS
            Javascript

    Extending the vocab of HTML

    You can build a SPA(Single page application) in angular

    Rich built in data binding capabilities which includes
        One way
            [Source to destination]/[Destination to source]
        Two way

    Built in directives
        directive is nothing but custom attributes for html tags (directives
        angular also provides built in custom elements

    Data transformation
        dynamic data transformation eg: if I select India as country then it should show currency in INR, etc
        Pipes : this is used for data transformation

    Forms
        template forms (simple forms where validation are done on UI)
        reactive forms (forms where validation are done on model)

    Dynamic/JIT(just in time) compilation and AoT compilation
        Do the changes in development and the compilation happens at client side then its Dynamic compilation (preferred in development mode, as compilation is done while dev simultaneously)
        Do the changes, build a package, test it and deploy then it is called AoT (ahead of time) compilation (also called as pre compilation of application and is prefered in prod) --> performance is more better as it is tested

    HTPP module

    Rich animations

    Eager loading vs Lazy loading

    Routing

    Language support for angular application development
        you can develope angular using 4 different languages
            ES5
            ECMA2015
            Typescript
            Dart

    Test ready code: Karma (test runner by google) / Jasmine (framework)
        Jasmine functions:
            Describe It

    Changes Detection cycle - is a process which is uni-directional

    Guidelines for Angular are available and Angular tells you what and why a particular thing is to be used. Refer : https://angular.io/guide/styleguide#style-guide

    Di capabilities (Dependency injection)

******Day 1

Angular Notes: Angular starts with :

    ngModule: (container)
        Manifest
        Root module
        contains lots of things
        list initially is empty, hence we need to register the components and modules

Demo project: commands (angular version log -- google)

    npm init
    npm install --save ---> required for production
    npm install --save-dev ---> required for production

***Local Setup of modules/polyfills npm install --save @angular/common@5.2.10 @angular/compiler@5.2.10 @angular/core@5.2.10 @angular/platform-browser@5.2.10 @angular/platform-browser-dynamic@5.2.10 rxjs@5.5.2 core-js zone.js

dev modules npm install --save-dev @types/node angular-router-loader angular2-template-loader awesome-typescript-loader@3.3.0 css-loader extract-text-webpack-plugin@3.0.2 file-loader html-loader html-webpack-plugin@2.30.1 null-loader raw-loader rimraf style-loader to-string-loader typescript webpack@3.8.1 webpack-dev-server@2.9.4 webpack-merge@4.1.1

npm install --save jquery bootstrap popper.js

**assignment

    Create a model in events feature (refer camera image)
    create 2 components
        events list
        event details (create a parent child relationship and display the event details on the click of the show details button show event details for 4 members: code, name, startdate & fees)

******Day 3 MongoDB:

    testing the port of the mongo DB : cmd "mongod"
    https://getbootstrap.com : to get the animations etc.

PIPES:

    user defined
    inbuilt

Filtering: https://bootswatch.com/

Steps to use a new NgModule:

    Install ngModule
    register into vendor.ts
    import in app.module.ts

--> install "Augury" by Ragel chrome extension if not installed (check F12 )


What is ngModel? it looks for a property in component class, if found then it will use it else it will declare one and use it (in our eg. searchChar is nowhere declared in event-list.component.ts class but it used as ngModel declared it.

Assignment: Create a pipe for startDate and change the existing filter-by pipe for startsWith eventname

Component Lifecycle hooks - these are interceptors for angular - all lifecycle hooks are interfaces Eg: - onChange - onInit

Promise vs Observable --> refer presentation

MongoDB -- start mongodb server : C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.4\bin>mongod -- db console : -> C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\3.4\bin>mongo -> show dbs -> use syne-hsbc-db; --> switches to db -> db.createCollection("events") --> creates collection -> show collections -> db.events.insert({}) -> db.events.find().pretty();

    Creation of DB in MongoDB
    node synechron-services.js --> this is to run the node server to connect to mongoDB

day 4***

    Module based seperation done EAGER LOADING
	
Navigation module
----------------
goto bootswatch.com and then choose any theme -> NavBar -> Copy whole code and remove forms tag in it.
	
Routing
-------
1. Download the router module
   npm install --save @angular/router@5.2.10
2. Register '@anguler/router' in vendor.ts file. Add import in vendor.ts
3. create new file app.router.ts in app folder only and configure it in module.ts file.
